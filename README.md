Since early teenage days, I've been curious about the web and have been making websites in my spare time. As I also enjoy helping people, I combined the two by working at Eventbrite's customer support team.

This has showed me a lot about how people use the internet and what they expect. As a junior web developer I strive to use these experiences and build user-friendly web projects.

I want to work in an environment where people are passionate about what they're doing and also that supports constant learning. I strongly believe in the agile methodology, pair programming and test-driven development.

#### Pragmatic
I can cut to the core of a problem and decide what's important to deliver real functionality as soon as possible.

When working for Eventbrite, I figured out the technical problem of the customer whilst being on the phone with them and then guided them to a solution. In case of bugs I passed on a concise but detailed description of it to the Engineering team.  


#### Love to learn
I'm always interested in learning. At University it was Middle English, and then moving abroad to learn about the English culture.  
At Eventbrite I learned how to localise American content for the German market.  
I chose to learn NodeJS during my final two-week project at Makers Academy.
