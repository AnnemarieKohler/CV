I’ve always had an insatiable curiosity about the web and how it works, so I  have been making websites in my spare time. As I also enjoy helping people, I combined the two by working at Eventbrite's customer support team. This showed me a lot about how people use the internet and what they expect. As a web developer I strive to use these experiences and build user-friendly web projects.

I want to work in an environment where people are passionate about what they're doing and also that supports constant learning. I strongly believe in the agile methodology, pair programming and test-driven development.

#### Pragmatic
I can cut to the core of a problem and decide what's important to deliver real functionality as soon as possible.

When working for Eventbrite, I figured out the technical problem of the customer whilst being on the phone with them and then guided them to a solution. In case of bugs I passed on a concise but detailed description of it to the Engineering team and followed through with the customer to ensure solution delivery.



#### Love to learn
I'm always interested in learning. One of my passions is the English language and culture which  is why I chose to study Modern and Middle English at University and then chose to move to the UK to satisfy my curiosity.

At Eventbrite I learned how to use technologies, such as SalesForce and AWS,  to localise American content for the German market. With the technical knowledge I could then develop more localised content for their product, such as emails and tutorials.

I chose to learn and use NodeJS during my final two-week project at Makers Academy, because I’ve read and heard a lot about it and wanted to try it out myself. Having used ruby-based framework, i.e. Sinatra and Rails, I wanted to explore a JavaScript backend and be able to compare them.

#### Languages
- German (native)
- English (fluent)
- Middle English (basic)
